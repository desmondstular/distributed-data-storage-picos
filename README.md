## About this Project

This project is part of the **CMPT 464** course, where we developed a **Distributed Data Storage System** using the **PicOS** platform for the **Texas Instrument CC1350 Launchpad** microprocessor board. The goal was to design and implement a system that allows nodes to communicate with each other wirelessly, store, retrieve, and manage information records across multiple nodes in a distributed environment.

### Key features of the system include:
- **Node Communication**: Each node is able to obtain a list of reachable neighbors and communicate with them.
- **Data Management**: Nodes can store, retrieve, and delete information records on other nodes as well as view and delete their own local records.
- **Wireless Application Design**: The project required the development of a wireless application that can run on each node using the PicOS operating system.

This assignment is designed to provide hands-on experience with distributed systems and wireless application development on embedded platforms, specifically focusing on **PicOS**.
